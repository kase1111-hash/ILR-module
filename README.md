# IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module (ILRM)

**Software Version:** 0.1.0-alpha
**Protocol Specification:** v1.5
**Status:** Alpha - Testnet Ready
**License:** Apache-2.0

> **Alpha Release Notice:** This is a pre-release version intended for testnet deployment and security review. Do not deploy to mainnet without completing the [Production Checklist](./PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md).

---

## Overview

The IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module (ILRM) is the core **IP dispute resolution** and **licensing reconciliation** component of the **NatLangChain** protocol. It provides **automated IP arbitration** through a non-adjudicative coordination system for compressing, de-escalating, and economically resolving **intellectual property mediation** cases and **license conflict resolution** scenarios.

This module enables **smart licensing disputes** handling using blockchain-based incentive mechanisms, making it an essential **IP conflict resolution tool** for the decentralized ecosystem.

> **NatLangChain doesn't govern people - it governs the price of conflict.**

ILRM does not adjudicate rights or render binding legal judgments. Instead, it provides a time-bounded, incentive-aligned coordination mechanism that:

- Encourages rapid settlement through economic incentives
- Penalizes prolonged disagreement via stake burns
- Preserves asset continuity through fallback licensing
- Produces structured data for future contract-risk analysis

---

## Important Notice

This project includes a `LICENSE_APPENDIX.md` that clarifies intended use and boundaries. The protocol and its modules are **non-adjudicative coordination tools**, not courts, judges, or legally binding arbitration systems. Any proposals, reconciliations, or license adjustments generated by the system are **non-authoritative and non-binding**, and require explicit participant acceptance.

---

## What Problem Does This Solve?

**How do you resolve licensing disputes automatically?** Traditional IP conflicts require expensive legal proceedings and extended timelines. ILRM provides **AI IP dispute resolution** through economic incentives rather than adjudication.

**Dealing with open source licensing disputes?** The module handles **automated license conflict** scenarios common in open source ecosystems, where multiple licenses may overlap or conflict.

**Need IP reconciliation automation?** ILRM offers **automated licensing arbitration** that compresses dispute timelines from months to days through stake-based coordination.

Key use cases:
- Resolving overlapping license claims on shared codebases
- De-escalating IP disputes before they reach litigation
- Establishing fallback licenses when parties cannot agree
- Providing economic disincentives for frivolous claims

- **Error Handling**: Typed errors with severity levels, circuit breaker pattern, retry logic

---

## Protocol Safety Invariants

The protocol guarantees 10 core safety properties:

1. **No Unilateral Cost Imposition** - Initiator must stake first
2. **Silence Is Always Free** - Ignoring voluntary requests costs nothing
3. **Initiator Risk Precedence** - Initiator exposed before counterparty
4. **Bounded Griefing** - Max 3 counters, exponential fees
5. **Harassment Is Net-Negative** - Escalating costs for repeat initiators
6. **Mutuality or Exit** - Timeout guarantees resolution
7. **Outcome Neutrality** - No winners/losers declared
8. **Economic Symmetry** - Matched stakes, identical timers
9. **Predictable Cost Surfaces** - All fees/burns explicit upfront
10. **Protocol Non-Sovereignty** - No legal authority claims

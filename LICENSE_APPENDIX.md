1. Purpose of This Appendix

This document supplements, but does not replace, the primary open-source license governing this repository (the Apache License, Version 2.0).

Its purpose is to:

Clarify intended and non-intended uses of the protocol

Prevent misrepresentation of system capabilities

Define non-adjudicative boundaries

Protect protocol integrity and associated trademarks

This appendix imposes no additional restrictions on the rights granted under Apache-2.0, but establishes binding representations and covenants for users, integrators, and deployers.

2. Non-Adjudication Covenant

This software and its associated specifications, modules, and reference implementations:

Do not adjudicate legal disputes

Do not render binding judgments

Do not determine legal ownership, fault, or liability

Do not replace courts, arbitrators, or legal processes

Any outputs generated by this system — including but not limited to:

proposals

reconciliations

license adjustments

settlement suggestions

are non-authoritative, non-binding, and coordination-oriented only, unless explicitly agreed otherwise by all involved parties through separate, external legal instruments.

3. Prohibited Misrepresentation

Users of this software MUST NOT market, describe, or represent the system as:

a “court”

a “judge”

an “arbitrator”

an “AI judge”

a legally binding dispute resolution authority

a replacement for licensed legal professionals

This prohibition applies to:

marketing materials

user interfaces

documentation

sales pitches

investor communications

Violations constitute material misrepresentation of the software’s function.

4. Intended Function (Affirmative Statement)

The system is intended solely to function as:

A coordination and reconciliation mechanism that applies economic incentives and time-bounded pressure to encourage voluntary resolution of contractual or licensing disagreements.

It is designed to:

reduce prolonged conflict

preserve asset continuity

discourage bad-faith stalling

minimize dispute entropy

It is not designed to determine truth, justice, or legal correctness.

5. Large Language Model (LLM) Disclaimer

Where Large Language Models or similar systems are used:

They operate as proposal generators, not decision-makers

Outputs are probabilistic and contextual

No guarantee of correctness, completeness, or legal validity is made

LLM outputs must always be subject to:

explicit human acceptance

on-chain confirmation

pre-agreed economic constraints

6. Economic Mechanisms Clarification

Mechanisms such as:

staking

escrow

burning

penalties

fallback licenses

exist solely to:

align incentives

discourage indefinite conflict

bound coordination costs

They do not constitute:

fines

damages

legal penalties

determinations of wrongdoing

7. Trademark & Naming Policy

The following names and identifiers are considered project identifiers and/or trademarks of the project maintainers:

ILRM (IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module)

Protocol names derived therefrom

Use of these names in a way that implies endorsement, certification, or official status requires explicit permission.

Forks and derivatives must clearly distinguish themselves in name and branding.

8. Commercial & Hosted Use Notice

Certain uses — including but not limited to:

offering this system as a hosted service

monetizing dispute resolution or reconciliation services

embedding the protocol into closed or proprietary platforms

may require a separate commercial license, even if the source code remains available under Apache-2.0.

See COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md or contact the maintainers for details.

9. Jurisdictional Neutrality

This project:

does not assume any specific jurisdiction

does not claim compliance with any specific legal regime

does not provide legal advice

Users are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction.

10. Severability

If any provision of this appendix is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect.

11. Acknowledgment of Use

By using, deploying, or integrating this software, you acknowledge that:

you accept responsibility for how it is presented and used

you will not misrepresent its authority or function

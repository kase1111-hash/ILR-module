Mobile Deployment
→ All modules (architectural feature; the entire system—including NatLangChain, ILRM, and RRA—is designed to run portably on-device via edge AI and mobile wallets).
Smart Contract Execution
→ IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module (ILRM) (triggers asset registry actions like minting, freezing, unfreezing, or applying fallback licenses on resolution).
Automated Escrow
→ IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module (ILRM) (stakes are escrowed symmetrically; released on acceptance or partially returned/burned on timeout).
Time-Bound Access
→ IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module (ILRM) (fallback licenses explicitly include time-limited, non-exclusive, auto-expiring terms).
Automated Verification
→ IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module (ILRM) + NatLangChain module (evidence canonicalization, provenance hashes, and contract clause verification are shared; ILRM enforces during disputes, NatLangChain uses during initial negotiation).
Dispute Prediction
→ IP & Licensing Reconciliation Module (ILRM) (the upcoming License Entropy Oracle in Phase 2 scores clause instability and predicts disputes using historical ILRM data; feeds back into NatLangChain for preemptive warnings).
